    <h1>About PotatoGuard</h1>
    <p>Using AI technology to help farmers protect their crops and livelihoods</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2 class="card-title">Our Mission</h2>
    <p>PotatoGuard was created to address the significant challenges that potato farmers face from diseases like Early Blight and Late Blight. These diseases can destroy entire crops if not detected and treated early.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to make advanced AI technology accessible to farmers of all scales, helping them identify problems early and take appropriate action to protect their crops.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <h2 class="card-title">How It Works</h2>
        <p>Our system uses a deep learning model based on DenseNet-121 architecture, trained on thousands of images of healthy and diseased potato plants.</p>
        <p>When you upload an image of your potato leaves, our AI model analyzes it and provides a diagnosis with a confidence score, along with recommended treatment options.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="card">
        <h2 class="card-title">Our Technology</h2>
        <p>We use state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that have been specifically trained for potato disease detection.</p>
        <p>The model achieves over 95% accuracy in distinguishing between Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy potato leaves under controlled conditions.</p>
